FP TREE FOR MARKET BASKET TRANSACTIONS
=======================================
Excercise involves the generation of a simple market-basket transaction record database and inserting the records in a frequent pattern tree (FP-Tree). 

Generation of the transaction record database is implemented using a Mersenne Twister pesudo-random number generator engine (mt19337_32). User must specify an integer seed value(This allows for generation of the same test set for performance evaluation of different algorithms and data structures). User also specifies the number of attributes in a transaction record along with the number of entries in the database.
